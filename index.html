            <h1>A bit about myself...</h1>
            <p>I am an undergradate studying Software Engineering at Bowling Green State Unviersity. In addition to my studies, I enjoy spending my free time working on projects. This school year I have started documenting projects on my github account. I currently maintain a 4.0 GPA and am also very involved in my unviersity's community.</p>
            <p>The most important project I am currently working on is planning a Hackathon that will be the first of its kind at my university. As President of our campus's ACM student chapter I am heading up a lot of the planning. Many of my other projects are focused on learning more about writing software. Over the recent summer, I spent my time studying Angular web development and by extension have learned a lot more about web development as a disipline. I am also very interested in the potential Clojure has for creating robust software due to its emphasis on immutability.</p>
            <p>I also have a handful of oddball involvements on campus. Since my first semester I have been a member of the Honors College at BGSU. Next semester I will be working as a peer facilitator for the honors course, <em>Critical Thinking About Great Ideas</em>. I am excited to be working with one of my most impactful professors in this role. Within the German Program I run a weekly German speaker meetup called <em>Kaffeeklatsch</em>. I also am a member of the BGSU Men's Chorus. This year we are performing <em>Carmina Burana</em> with the Toledo Symphony. Whenever I need a break from all of my involvements I will often tend to the many plants I grow in my dorm room.</p>
