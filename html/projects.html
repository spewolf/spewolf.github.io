        <h2>BGSU Hackathon</h2>
        <p>The project which I am most excited about currently is the Hackathon at my University. As the President of our Association for Computing Machinery student chapter I wanted to build the community within our CS department. The two biggest new events to work towards this goal have been a weekly study session and the Hackathon. Being the first time we host this event, we are planning to start smaller. My goal is for this to grow into a large signature event.</p>
        <h2>FSRC Autofiller</h2>
        <p>As a Resident Advisor I am required to write a lot of records about my residents where I repeat the same information every time. I had some free time at my disposal over the summer so I threw together an automatic data entry system for the records. I first figured out how to type in a record into the website using only the keyboard. At that point I broke out python and started prototyping a system to type in entries. After some trial and error I got a working prototype together in Python. Since changing to this system I have been able to reduce my time spent on reports by <strong>75%</strong>. A 40 minute session now takes me only ten minutes.</p>
        <h2>Personal Portfolio Site</h2>
        <p>You are currently looking at the result of this project. I recently learned that github will host a static website for free and so I decided to try my hand at a basic portfolio. I haven't worked without a framework in awhile so I decided to build this website only using the basics starting out.</p>
        <h2>Weather-Demo</h2>
        <p>I had not touched Angular for a few months after coming back to university so I decided to make this demo for two reasons. I wanted to make a basic Angular 2+ project that would help people who need a simple example starting out. I also wanted to reinforce what I learned over the summer so that I don't forget how to use Angular.</p>
