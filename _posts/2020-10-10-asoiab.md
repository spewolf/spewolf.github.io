One of my earliest memories is seeing the rising ridges of ice out in the lake near where I lived. As the temperatures dropped well below where any reasonable person would be outside the ice sheets on the lake would push into each other creating these tiny mountains of ice. As a non-reasonable person, I would decide to go outside and investigate this ridge of 4 foot tall ice jutting out. I encountered the most beautiful spikes of clear ice. You could see through them like glass.

Cue my dissapointment a few years later in 2020. To be more specific because this has been a disappointing year for all of us, it had to do with ice. My uncle had an old minifridge in his garage he wasn't using. He generously offered it to me and I was happy to take it to college with me. For the first month I felt like some kind of magician being able to turn things cold. Eventually I came to the conclusion that I need some ice cubes. I got a real nice baby blue tray (one of my favorite colors) and poured some water in excited to see the result. To my dismay the ice was cloudy and white, bearing no resembelance to the ice of my childhood.

I turned to the internet for help. It turns out that there is loads of people like me, disappointed by lackluster ice. Apparently making clear ice is an art. One does not simply make water cold if you want to be making real ice. There are giant machines that agitate water so that it doesn't freeze with bubbles inside. There are people that boil their water two times before putting it in the freezer. Some people just fill up igloo coolers with water and only let it half freeze so all the air is pushed to the bottom and then they cut up the ice like in the opening scene of Frozen.

Currently I have a friendly bet with a friend to see which one of us can make clear bubbleless ice first. I will update this blog if I make any breakthroughs but I have some theories so far. Stay tuned and stay hydrated my friends.
